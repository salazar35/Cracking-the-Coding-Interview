# Python tips and tricks

> Python tips and tricks

These are quick tips and tricks that I collected in the journey with Python.

This repository contains:

1. My codes that I've learned in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).
2. A lot of useful notes in Python, please find them in this file.

## Background

From the start, I were a system engineer. I start to learn Python 3 years ago, but it was not continuous. Now when I decide to start again in a serious way, I'm at age of 30s. I always confuse about it, and it seems to be stupid when I decide to leave my current job to follow my dream...

**Writing READMEs is way too hard, and keeping them maintained is difficult. By offloading this process - making writing easier, making editing easier, making it clear whether or not an edit is up to spec or not - you can spend less time worry about whether or not your initial documentation is good, and spend more time writing and using code.**

`As well, standardizing can help elsewhere. By having a standard, users can spend less time searching for the information they want. They can also build tools to gather search terms from descriptions, to automatically run example code, to check licensing, and so on.`

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
```

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
